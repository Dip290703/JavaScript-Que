ðŸ“’ HTML & CSS Interview Notes
HTML

Semantic tags â†’ <header>, <footer>, <article>; improve readability, SEO & accessibility.

Block vs Inline â†’ Block: new line, full width (<div>, <p>). Inline: same line (<span>, <a>).

id vs class â†’ id = unique (one element), class = reusable (multiple elements).

HTML vs HTML5 â†’ New semantic tags, <audio>, <video>, <canvas>, localStorage/sessionStorage, new input types.

localStorage vs sessionStorage vs cookies â†’

localStorage = permanent (until cleared).

sessionStorage = only current session.

cookies = small data sent with every request (good for auth).

CSS

Positioning â†’

static (default),

relative (self),

absolute (relative to parent),

fixed (viewport),

sticky (scroll + relative).

Inline vs Internal vs External CSS â†’

inline = style="",

internal = <style> tag,

external = separate .css file (best).

Pseudo-classes vs Pseudo-elements â†’

Pseudo-class = state (:hover, :focus, :nth-child()).

Pseudo-element = part of element (::before, ::after).

Relative vs Absolute units â†’

Absolute = px, pt (fixed).

Relative = em (parent), rem (root), % (parent size). Better for responsiveness.

Media queries â†’ @media (max-width: 768px) { ... } â†’ apply styles based on device width. Used for responsive design.
